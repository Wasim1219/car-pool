Persistence Model: Jordan

Risks Identified:

Loss of data 
Backup database

Synchronisation of concurrent access 
Need to look into a solution, or if it is already solved by database.  Must ensure I incorporate it into database design.

 Security
What can access what?  Who can change what?

Make views, ensure users are not interacting with database directly.  Use privileged accounts with restrictions.


 Correctness
Create database in line with domain model.  Create all possible DB  constraints (Foreign keys, primary keys, look into more)
