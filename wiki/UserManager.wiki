#summary How To use the User, UserManager and UserFactory classes

= Introduction =

I will attempt to explain how to use the code I have created.  It's a work in progress and more detail will follow on the other methods in !UserManager


= Details =
{{{
// To get a current users details from the database:
UserManager manager = new UserManager();
String openid = "http://user.someprovider.com/";
User user = null;

try {    
    user = manager.getUserByOpenId(openid);
}catch( InvaildUserNamePassword iunpe ) {
    // there is probably no openid of that id in the database
} catch( IOException ioe ) {
    // a communication problem I think
} catch( SQLException sqle ) {
    // there is some problem with the sql statement whether
    // that be a database end problem or the sql was badly
    // written will be in the message string if you wish to print it.
}

// To get the username
String username = user.getUserName();

// email
String email = user.getEmail();
// phone number
String phone = user.getPhoneNumber();
// memeber since ie sighnup date
Calendar memberSince = user.getMemberSince();
// A set of the openids associated with this user
Set<String> openidSet = user.getOpenIds();
}}}

There are other methods, in !User as well, but these are the only ones that actually return any useful data at the moment.
