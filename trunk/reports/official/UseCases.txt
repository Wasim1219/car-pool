. The following use cases are 
not in proper format but will serve us for now: 


1. Registering for Car Pool 
- The user clicks on the Register button 
- The system takes the user to the Registration Form 
- The user choose a user name and checks if this user name is 
available 
- The user choose a password and enters it 
- The user adds other details asked for if they want to 
- The user clicks on the Done button 
- The system tells the user to check their email address and click on 
the confirmation link 
- The user goes and clicks on the confirmation link 
- The system verifies the confirmation link and confirms the user's 
account 
- Alternatively: The user does not click the confirmation link within 
the given time period so the system deletes the user's account 
information 
-  once account has been confirmed the user is free to modify their 
account details 


2. Add a Ride (Request & Offer) 
-  The user clicks the Add A Ride button 
- The system takes the user to the Create a Ride Form 
- The user specifies if the ride is a one off or a regularly scheduled 
one. Depending on what they have chosen they will either enter the 
date and time of the ride or the days and times the ride is scheduled 
for 
- The user specifies the location FROM and TO and VIA. (The cities/ 
towns can be chosen from a drop down box and the specific location of 
pick up and drop off specified in a text field) 
- The user specifies if the trip is a return trip or one way. If it is 
a return trip the user specifies the time for the return trip 
- The user specifies if they are Requesting a Ride or Offering a Ride. 
- If the user is Requesting a Ride they specify the seats requested 
and if the user is Offering a Ride they specify the seats available. 
- The user can add any extraneous details through the comments section 
- The user clicks on Confirm 
- The system confirms the Ride has been added to the database 
- The system adds the ride to the Driver's calendar. If the user is a 
Rider (Requesting a Ride) nothing is added to calendar. 
- The system adds the route to the Ride page's Google Map. 


3. Accept Ride Offered 
- The Rider can search for rides according to location (we are going 
to have to decide how user can search for rides that may pass through 
the locatioon they want to get even if it isn't a pick up or drop off 
point) 
- The Rider clicks on the ride they are interested in and the system 
takes the Rider to the page with more details on the ride 
- The Rider can talk to the Driver via the comments section and 
negotiate things 
- Once the Rider is satisfied they can click on Accept Ride and 
specify the number of seats they will be taking up 
- The system reduces the number of seats accordingly after ride has 
been accepted. 
- The system adds the Ride to the Rider's Calendar 
(we need to decide if the Driver has the right to refuse a Rider....) 


4. Accept Ride Requested 
- The Driver searches for requested rides according to location. 
- The Driver clicks on the ride they are interested in 
- The Driver clicks on Accept Request or Counter-Offer (or clicks away 
from the page...) 
- If the Driver clicks on Accept Request the system sends Rider 
notificaion email and enters info into Rider and Driver's calendars 
- If the Driver clicks on Counter-Offer then the system takes Driver 
to form that looks like Create A Ride form with the details the Rider 
has entered filled in. The Driver can then modify these details 
according to the counter offer they are creating and the system sends 
the Rider a notification email with these details. The Rider can 
accept the counter offer or reject it. 
- If the Rider accepts Counter Offer then their Ride Request is 
updated as Fulfilled. Their and the driver's calendar is updated 
appropriately. 
- Regardless of if the Rider accepts or rejects Counter Offer the 
Driver can choose to make this Counter Offer public as a Ride Offer 


(okay I know the last few points became horrible convoluted. Can 
someone simplify it/think of an alternative way of doing things?) 


5. Withdraw/Edit Request or Offer 
- The user can do this by clicking on the Withdraw button (in their 
Profile Page? On the Ride page?) or Editing the relevant details 
- An Offer can only be edited or withdrawn 24 Hours before Departure 
Time. A Request can be withdrawn at any time (??) 
- If people have accepted rides and the offer is withdrawn they are 
sent a notification email. 


6. Rating Rider/Driver 
(I can see this working kind of like the Trade Me thing) 
- The user clicks on the Rate Rider/Driver button on their History 
page. 
- The user rates the driver and adds comments 
- The other person's social score is updated as well as their history 
page.
