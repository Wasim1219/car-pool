#summary Briefly explains the session attributes set by the authentication process

= Introduction =

The purpose of this Wiki is to inform the other members of the team what attributes have been set by the authentication process.


= Details =

When a user is logged in the authentication process sets the following attributes into the session:

 * "user" - a instance of User with data identifying the user including the following information
  # username
  # password if they aren't just using OpenId
  # a set of OpenIds associated with this user, if they are using OpenId to authenticate themselves
  # phone number
  # email
  # member since - the date they first registered
 * "signedin" - set to say this person using this session has been logged in

To check to see if the person using this session is logged in, use the following code.
{{{
if(session.getAttribute("signedin") != null) {
    //user is logged in
}
}}}

To retrieve the instance of User held in the attributes of this session, use the following code.
{{{
User user = (User)session.getAttribute("user");
}}}

Hope this helps
