Summary of achievement so far:

Changes to Project Plan:
Project Plan has been updated to mention that the construction phase
is complete. If integration does not go as planned then more time and
resources will be allocated for that phase. The scope is still the same.


Obstacles Encountered:
James mentioned that he was having issues with OpenID. These will need 
to be looked into.


Issues that are Open for more than 7 days:
There is an OpenID issue in the issue tracking open just for 4 days.
It will need to be looked at before the end of the week.


Where do we go from here:
- Need to confirm our domain model is on the right track from an expert.
- Need to flesh out our use cases and develop a sequence diagram.
- Need to start writing up the use cases in the proper format for the 
impending report. Same for the RMMM.
- Need to ask Arlo for server diagram, Jordan for ER diagram
 for design documentation
- Need to have a look at all the different components as a team
- Need to then ensure their successful integration by the end of the week
- Need to research on automating things via ANT
- Need to start testing integration and components
- Need to develop SQA reports
