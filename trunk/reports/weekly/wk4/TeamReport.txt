Weekly Progress Report

Week 4
Date submitted: 11/08/2008

Summary of achievement from last week:
- Report One successfully handed over
- When users offer rides it gets added to the database
- All the rides offered can be seen through find a ride
- From the Find A Ride page user can click on a ride and it gets accepted



Obstacles Encountered:

Google Calendar seems to be working some of the time and sometimes not.
Things just all took a lot longer than anticipated.



Changes to Project Plan:

Like mentioned last week we had thought we would get time to spend a week making the prototype 'look good'/increase the scope but the integration took longer than expected so this did not work out. That is why currently though things work in the 'back end' of the system most of the stuff cannot be seen on the interface. E.g. A list of all the rides a user has personally accepted or offered. 
 

Where from here:

First we are going to revaluate our subversion directory structure. It seems to have a lot of redundant stuff in it.

Next we are going to discuss what kind of things can be improved in our process to make prototype two's development go smoother

Then we will discuss the tasks that need to be done with respect to our project plan and the resources to be allocated to each task

Finally we will do some usability testing on our interface so we can get early feedback from users about what in our interface works and what doesn't really. This feedback will be incorporated into our tasks.
