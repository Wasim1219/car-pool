
Issues Expected:

- Concurrency issue with database.  
E.g. If two people accept a ride at the same time who gets it? How are the number of seats affected?

- Session tracking: users shouldn't have to log in each time they want to perform an action like Offer or Accept a Ride. 

- How will people search for their rides/ narrow them down

- We need to be able to send an automated email out to a person if someone has accepted a ride etc

- Some sort of RSS feed regarding all rides that get offered for certain locations
